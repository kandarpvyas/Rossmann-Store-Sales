# RossmannSales
This project is about the analysis of Rossmann Store Sales dataset and builds a model to predict next six-week store sales values. The dataset comes from Kaggle competition supported by Rossmann Store Sales. We started by performing comprehensive analysis on the dataset, explored features and collected all features we thought were useful for the prediction models. For forecasting and predicting sales we used linear regression, bagging regressor, random forest regressor and time series using prophet. We calculated Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE), Model accuracy in terms of percentage and prediction of sales value. Lastly, we applied Keras sequential model to build neural network and used TensorFlow in backend


# RossmannSales
Repository containing my solution for the Rossmann Store Sales challenge 
from Kaggle.

Challenge description and data on https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales. 

In order to use this code, you need the following tools:
## Requirements

To replicate the findings and execute the code in this repository you will need
basically the next Python packages:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
- [SciKit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Keras Sequential Model](https://keras.io/models/sequential/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Facebook Prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet/)
 
 
Then you need the files containing the data (available on https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data):
 * store.csv
 * test.csv
 * train.csv
